abstract: "MaterForge is an extensible, open-source Python library that streamlines the definition and use of material properties in numerical simulations. The library converts user-friendly YAML configuration files into symbolic mathematical expressions, supports multiple property definition methods, and automatically resolves dependencies. It is designed for high-performance computing applications and serves as a bridge between experimental data and numerical simulation."
